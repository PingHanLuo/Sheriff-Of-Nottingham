# Sheriff-Of-Nottingham

## Intro
========
##### This is a quick hack of the board game Sheriff of Nottingham. I have chosen to abandon some key features for now due to the lack of time. Currently this project suffers from bad UI design (since I quickly made it in text) and the lack of security to prevent users from making false ajax requests, these two major issues would be addressed but since they would just require time costly TDD I opted to ignore them for now. It is a web app that would run within the browser with the server code and client code enabled.
